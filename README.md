# CMPT 130 - Assignment 5: Connect 4 game
A complicated, artificial intelligence-based game for my CMPT 130 (Introduction to Computer Programming) class that challenges my first-year programming experience in C++.

Specific tasks included:

* Implementing the Connect 4 gameboard using C++ vectors and matrices to display the gameboard in ASCII characters
* Managing game interaction using C++ input and output streams to feature player's moves using the letters in the keyboard
* Analyzing when the player wins or when they want to restart/quit the game using test-driven development
